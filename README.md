This project ensures trust and safety by storing no personal data including pictures and video of users. All processing is run locally. 

The LensAI project digitally superimposes contact lenses onto a user’s eye in live camera feeds and images. We deploy a novel convolution neural network (CNN) via a webapp to offer an interactive platform on both desktop and mobile. This webapp can easily be implemented into storefronts or as a kiosk. The platform contains different colours and designs for users to better inform their purchasing decisions. We also give insights into customer preferences. The designs can be adjusted to reflect the available products on a retailer's site. This platform uses a contemporary and intuitive interface which underscores our commitment to maximising reach. First, we employ an industry standard Facial Landmarks Model to localise the eyes in the image. Subsequently, we apply our custom Iris Landmarks Model to provide the location of the iris. Next, a unique approach to image filtering and masking is applied to change the colour of the user’s iris which maximises realism. We achieve precise detection of facial features across a diverse dataset to achieve a 98.75% accuracy, affirming the efficacy of our approach.
